Sunshine Hours and Consumer Engagement Analysis
Overview
This repository contains the code, data processing scripts, and visualisations used to explore the relationship between sunshine hours and consumer engagement. The project investigates how variations in weather, specifically sunshine duration, impact consumer mood and comfort, and consequently influence their engagement behaviours such as time spent on site, page views, and interaction rates.

Understanding these connections can help businesses and content creators optimise the timing and nature of their offerings to align with environmental factors, potentially increasing user satisfaction and engagement.

Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are to:

Analyse historical weather data focusing on sunshine hours.

Examine consumer engagement metrics and their variations with weather conditions.

Identify correlations or trends that suggest weather-driven mood and comfort influence engagement.

Provide actionable insights that can inform content strategy and marketing efforts.

Data Description
The project utilises one main data sources:

Weather Data: Includes daily sunshine hours and other meteorological variables such as temperature, precipitation, and cloud cover, covering the period [1979 to 2020].


Methodology
The analysis follows a structured approach:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, removing outliers, and aligning datasets by date.

Feature Engineering: Creating composite indices such as a Comfort Index based on weather variables to better represent user comfort.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualising trends, seasonal patterns, and initial correlations between sunshine hours and engagement.

Statistical Analysis: Applying correlation tests and regression models to quantify relationships and test significance.

Segmentation: Clustering days based on engagement and weather profiles to identify patterns.

Reporting: Summarising findings and producing visual outputs to support conclusions.

Repository Structure
notebooks/ – Contains Jupyter notebooks used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualisation.

data/ – Holds raw and processed datasets (note: sensitive data excluded or anonymised).


visualisations/ – Stores figures, charts, and graphs generated during analysis.
